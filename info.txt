Setup Instructions

    Install Dependencies:
        Existing requirements:
        bash

    pip install requests spacy pocketsphinx pyttsx3 sqlite3 pywhatkit python-dotenv pycaw pyautogui httpx beautifulsoup4 psutil pytesseract PyPDF2 pillow torch hf_xet transformers==4.41.2
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

    If you have a GPU and want to leverage it, visit PyTorch's official site to get the correct command for your CUDA version. For example, with CUDA 11.8:
    pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed (for PDF parsing).

Set API Keys: Same .env file as before.
Prepare Specials File:

    Text File: item:price:store:lat:lon (e.g., milk:15.99:Shoprite:-33.9249:18.4241).
    PDF: Text like "milk R15.99 at Shoprite lat -33.9249 lon 18.4241" (NLP parses this).

Web Scraping:

    Replace store_urls in apis.py with real URLs (e.g., Shoprite’s specials page).
    Adjust .select() calls to match the site’s HTML structure.
    Update store_locations with real coordinates.


The error you're encountering indicates that the transformers library, which you're using to load the distilgpt2 model for text generation in conversation.py, requires either PyTorch or TensorFlow 2.0+ to be installed in your environment. These frameworks are necessary for model inference, and without them, the pipeline function cannot proceed.

Here's how to resolve this issue step-by-step:
Step 1: Install a Framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow)

You need to install at least one of these frameworks in your virtual environment (.venv). I recommend starting with PyTorch as it’s widely used with the transformers library and has good compatibility with distilgpt2.
Option 1: Install PyTorch

    Activate your virtual environment (already done in your case):
    powershell

.\.venv\Scripts\activate

Install PyTorch. The exact command depends on your system (Windows, CPU/GPU, etc.). For a CPU-only installation on Windows:
powershell
pip install torch

If you have a GPU and want to leverage it, visit PyTorch's official site to get the correct command for your CUDA version. For example, with CUDA 11.8:
powershell

    pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

Option 2: Install TensorFlow

Alternatively, you can install TensorFlow:
powershell
pip install tensorflow

For simplicity, I’ll proceed with PyTorch as it’s lighter for this use case unless you specifically need TensorFlow.
Step 2: Verify Installation

After installing, verify that PyTorch (or TensorFlow) is available:
powershell
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"

This should output a version number (e.g., 2.4.0). If you installed TensorFlow instead:
powershell
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
Step 3: Test Your Code Again

Once PyTorch or TensorFlow is installed, try running your script again:
powershell
python main.py

The RuntimeError should no longer occur, and the distilgpt2 model should load successfully.
Additional Considerations

    Dependencies: Ensure all other dependencies (e.g., transformers, spacy, etc.) are installed. You can check your requirements.txt or run:
    powershell

pip install transformers spacy
For Spacy, you’ll also need a language model:
powershell
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Environment Check: If you’re unsure about your current environment’s packages, list them:
powershell
pip list
Model Download: The first run of pipeline("text-generation", model="distilgpt2") will download the model files (~353 MB). Ensure you have an internet connection and enough disk space.
GPU Support: If you’re using a GPU, confirm it’s detected:
powershell

    python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
    If True, PyTorch will use your GPU; if False, it defaults to CPU.

Updated Workflow

Here’s what your terminal session might look like after fixing this:
powershell
(.venv) PS C:\Users\DRAGOHN\Documents\GitHub\remi> pip install torch
Collecting torch
  Downloading torch-2.4.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl (269.9 MB)
  ...
Successfully installed torch-2.4.0
(.venv) PS C:\Users\DRAGOHN\Documents\GitHub\remi> python main.py

If you encounter further errors after installing PyTorch or TensorFlow:

    Share the new error message.
    Provide the output of pip list so I can check your environment.

Let me know once you’ve installed one of these frameworks, and I’ll assist with any follow-up steps!
